- **FR-13.2.1.2 Directional Sprites:** Unit sprites/models shall correctly represent the direction the unit is facing (e.g., 8-directional sprites).

### 13.2.2 Building Visuals
- **FR-13.2.2.1 Construction Animation:** As a building is constructed, its visual representation shall progress from a foundation to the completed structure.
- **FR-13.2.2.2 Damage States:** Buildings shall show increasing visual damage (e.g., cracks, fires) as their HP decreases.
- **FR-13.2.2.3 Destruction:** When a building is destroyed, it shall play a destruction animation and leave behind a rubble sprite.
- **FR-13.2.2.4 Working Animation:** Some buildings (e.g., Blacksmith, Mill) shall have an animation that plays when they are actively researching or working.

### 13.2.3 Visual Effects (VFX)
- **FR-13.2.3.1 Projectiles:** Ranged attacks shall generate visible projectile objects (arrows, bolts, stones) that travel from the attacker to the target.
